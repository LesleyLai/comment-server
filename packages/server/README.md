# Comments Server
I am tired of third-party comment server, so I build one my own to power [my blog](https://lesleylai.info).

## Build
```
yarn build
```

## Test

```
yarn test
```

Need to `build` first.

## Watch

In one terminal

```
yarn watch
```

to enable the hot recompilation.

In another terminal

```
yarn watch-run
```

to watch change in the source and automatically restart the server.
