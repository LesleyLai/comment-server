# Comments Server
I am tired of third-party comment servers, so I try to build one to power [my blog](https://lesleylai.info). It is not in a usable stage yet.

## Develop
### Build
```
yarn build
```

### Test

```
yarn test
```

Need to `build` first.

### Watch

In one terminal

```
yarn watch
```

to enable the hot recompilation.

In another terminal

```
yarn watch-run
```

to watch change in the source and automatically restart the server.
